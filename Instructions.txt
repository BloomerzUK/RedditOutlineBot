If you have any questions, message me on reddit at /u/lightumbra or leave an issue on github. I'm more likely to respond to a reddit message.

Options:

-d --debug
    Runs the script with debug additional information output to log.


How to install:

1) Install Python 3.6 or higher
    a)For Windows, use the download here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
    b)For Linux, use your distro's package manager.
    
2) Install pip. Pip is a package manager that allows you to easily downloadand install python libraries, frameworks, and other pieces of python software.
    a)For Windows, this should come with the Python download.
    b)For Linux, this may require an additional download.
    
3) Use pip to download and install the required modules. Specific commands are below.
    a)For Windows, type the following lines in a command prompt.
    b)For Linux, type the following lines in a your terminal.
    
    pip install praw
    pip install beautifulsoup4
    
    If you also have Python 2 installed, you may have to use "pip3" instead of "pip".

4)Download the .py file for the bot you want to use and put it in a new folder.
    a) Download the example praw.ini file and put it in the same folder as you but the .py file.
        i) This .ini file will hold the username, password, client_id, and client_secret for your bot. We will get these later.
        
5)Make a new reddit account for your bot.
    a) Open the praw.ini file paste the username after "username=" and the password after "password=".
        i) Keep this file open for later.
        
6)Now we will set the new account up as a bot. - There is a picture with an example called "apps.PNG".
    a) Log into the new account using the username and password made in the previous step.
    b) Go to the following url: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/
    c) Click the button that says "are you a developer? create an app..."
    d) For the name, add the username of your bot. 
    e) Select the script box
    f) Add a short description of your bot and it's purpose.
    g) The about URL can be ignored.
    h) Put "http://127.0.0.1" in the redirect uri box.
    i) Click "create app".
    j) Copy the secret to "client_secret=" in your praw.ini file.
    k) Copy the string of characters under "personal use script" to "client_id=" in your praw.ini file. 
    l) Change the text between the brackets in your praw.ini file to be the same as the bot's username.
    
7)Open archive_bot.py or outline_bot.py in your text editor and change the following information to match your bot.
    a) contact_info = "" - add your username or subreddit name into the quotes, including the /u/ or /r/. If you give it the name of a subreddit, it will send a message to that sub's mods.
    b) working_sub = "" -  Add the name of the subreddit, without the /r/, between the quotes.
    c) bot_UN = "" - Add the username of the bot, without the /u/, between the quotes. This should match the text between the brackets in the praw.ini file.
    
8)You will now be able to run either bot, but it will not include any quotes. Directions to add a quote list are below.
    
    When you start your script, a new file should be made to store the ids for posts that have already been processed. This file should be called "subreddit_posts_replied_to.txt", with "subreddit" being 
    replaced by what you entered in step 7b. If this file isn't made automatically, create an empty text file that follows called "subreddit_posts_replied_to.txt", with "subreddit" being replaced by what you entered in step 7b.
    
    a) To run the script in Windows, go to the folder with your .py folder. In the address bar at the top of the window, type cmd and hit enter. This should open up a command prompt window in that directory.
        i) Type "python bot_name.py", replacing "bot_name.py" with the name of your .py file. 
        ii) The script will begin running. Closing out of this window will stop the script, so it needs to stay open.
        iii) If you want to stop the script, hit "Ctrl+c". You can restart it by following step i again.
        
        If you also have Python 2 installed, you may have to use "python3" instead of "python".
        
    b) To run the script on Linux, open your terminal and cd to the directory with your script.
        i) You will need to make it executable by running "chmod a+x bot_name.py", replacing "bot_name.py" with the name of your .py file. Depending on your setup this may require sudo.
        ii) Then you can run the script by entering "./bot_name.py", replacing "bot_name.py" with the name of your .py file.
        iii) The script will begin running. Closing out of this window will stop the script, so it needs to stay open.
        iv) If you want to stop the script, hit "Ctrl+c". You can restart it by following step ii again.
        
        
        
Adding quotes - example file is available (example_quotes.txt):

1) Create a file called "subreddit_quotes.txt", replacing "subreddit" with the subreddit name you entered in step 7b.

2) Open this new file and enter your first quote. Your quotes should follow Reddit's markdown formatting, (i.e. two enters for a new line, *for italics*, **for bold text**, [links](www.not_shady_link.com), etc.).

3) At the end of the this quote, hit enter twice, type two dashes (--), and hit enter two more times.

4) Enter your next quote.

5) Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all your quotes.
